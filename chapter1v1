    m "Ehem..."
    m "So basically..."
    m "I'm gonna give you 2 options to choose from!"
    m "1. You can live a new life, experience what was taken from you!"
    m "You will still keep your current appearance and memory."
    m "Though, you can't live in your previous world."
    m "Multiple worlds do exists, in case you didn't know!"
    m "We Deities watch over them for since long ago."

    m "But of course, some are uniquely different as well."

    p "Sure?"
    m "Listen up!"
    m "There can never be the same person across these worlds!"
    m "Meaning... {w}there's no parallel you, or parallel someone else!"
    m "So you don't have to worry about meeting yourself in other worlds!"
    p "I see..."
    p "So, basically, I can experience life again, but only in “another world”."
    p "And I will also keep my appearance and my memories?"
    m "Correct!"
    m "I hear it's like “New Game+”!"
    m "Well, people on your world usually call it that..."
    m "I don't know what that means, though..."
    p "Hahaha, it's not New Game+, but close enough, I guess..."
    "So basically, the first option is that I can transfer to another world, and live my life there."
    "My appearance and memory will still be intact, that's a lot better than a reset."
    p "What about the other option?"
    m "Option number 2. You can go directly to Heaven!"
    m "You can enjoy a peaceful life, lying down in a field of grass..."
    m "Eating freshly picked fruits... and enjoying the scenery of a majestic river!"
    m "Well, basically anything people usually do in Heaven!"
